### Challenges

During the build of this website I faced some minor setbacks but nothing I unable to overcome. When encountering problems I didn't just seek a quick solution and move on but rather I wanted to fully understand what caused it and how to avoid it for future reference. I think being able to adapt to different situations and learn on the fly is a valuable skill to have, especially in Software Engineering where Technologies are always changing.

I've learnt and gained experience in:

- React Hooks: How they work compared to traditional class based components and the appropriate use cases for each hook.
- Caveats to using newer features of React, understanding `useEffect` dependency array, clean-up functions and when to use complex hooks such as `useCallback` and `useMemo`.
- React Context API and how to efficiently manage global state using `useReducer`.
- Building React components in a loosly coupled and reusable manner.
- Abstracting repeated logic into custom hooks.
- Database modeling and collections with Strapi CMS.
- Intergrations with Stripe Payment API.
- Handling cloud storage uploads with Amazon S3.
- Server/database deployment and configuration using Heroku premium dynos.
